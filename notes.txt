x 1. The Creator profile pic cannot be scraped. KaloData doesn't allow it. (Handled) removed pfp_link from schema.

x 2. The scrape details function for products is not correct. It does not properly scrape all dynamic data elements like revenue total and revenue per day. Figure it Out. (Handled) recoded the scraping part and it works fine now.

3. There is no attribute as "video_description" to be scraped from an individual video. Remove it from schema.
